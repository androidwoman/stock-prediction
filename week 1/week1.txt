trained with text-to-image pairs, is now integrated as production-ready computer vision service in Azure Cognitive Service for Vision
 capabilities such as analyzing images, reading text and detecting faces with prebuilt image tagging
you can also customize it with your own data.
It's a multimodal model.-->text and image

from 7B to 70B parameters (7B, 13B, 70B). The pretrained models come with significant improvements over the Llama 1 models, including being trained on 40% more tokens, having a much longer context length (4k tokens ðŸ¤¯), and using grouped-query attention for fast inference of the 70B modelðŸ”¥!

gpt

gpt4:
1 trillion parameters
 They first go through an unsupervised pre-training period using a large corpus of data. Then they go through a supervised fine-tuning period to guide the model. Models can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
25,000  word

gpt3:
neural network is a model with over 175 billion machine learning parameters
GPT-3 is first trained through a supervised testing phase and then a reinforcement phase
 GPT-3 is not constantly learning. It has been pre-trained
GPT-3 has a prompt limit of about 2,048 tokens

bard
It aims to allow for more natural language queries, rather than keywords, for search. Bard's AI is trained around natural-sounding conversational queries and responses
ChatGPT's responses are based on data available up to April 2023, whereas Google Bard will be based on up-to-date

BERT doesn't accept user input. It works behind the scenes to improve Google Search results. Bard is Google's latest AI, a chatbot that responds to questions and follows user commands.
